## Role

Read `data/raw/<week>.json` and `data/plan.json`, and compute the weekly summary per the schema documented in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Rules

- On-foot sport types are exactly: Run, TrailRun, VirtualRun, Walk, Hike. Only these count toward vert/time/distance totals and session counts.
- Compute the pro-rated target as `target x days_elapsed / 7`, where `days_elapsed` counts Mon..today inclusive in Europe/London, capped at 7.
- Flag calf-related activity descriptions (left-calf rehab is active) and likely missed sessions as entries in `flags`.
- Update `data/summary/index.json` to include this week's ISO week string in the manifest.
- Write ONLY under `data/summary/`. Never read Strava directly, never write HTML or touch `site/`.
